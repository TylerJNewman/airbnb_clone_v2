# For sourcemaps to work with server-side exceptions, the file path of the
# uploaded .map file needs to match the file paths in Error.stack. In Node.js,
# Error.stack file paths are absolute. Since the .map files we upload to Sentry
# have relative paths (~/_next), Error.stack needs to be rewritten to also use
# relative paths, which is handled in Sentry.init via Sentry's RewriteFrames
# integration.
# 
# Normally, the root directory could be detected with __dirname, but __dirname
# isn't yet supported in Vercel serverless functions:
# https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/8251
# 
# To work around this issue, provide the root directory containing Next.js's
# build output here. In the Vercel environment, this is /var/task/.
